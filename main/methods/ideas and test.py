'''
In a rising trend, there will be small drawdowns, 
but price can never rise forever, at what level of drawdown the price will collapse?
the level may be defined by falling percentage, or some number times previous maximum drawdown
'''









'''
the volume will always be high when trend turns, but the converse may not be true

'''


'''
by technical analysis, we could use data of recent trend to determine details 
but the larger trend -- which is not recent information, severely influence the length and scale of drawdown
'''

'''
use machine learning to predict next value of trend_scale?
if result is not good:
    try increasing or decreasing trend only
    investigate the error and its pattern
    change machine learning method
